# Metadata

## Data Summary
This dataset originally had 12 columns and 2,098,325 rows. We ended up narrowing the final dataset only to include 8 columns and 2,097,208 rows. One of the columns (Review_Buckets) was added to the original columns by assigning scores that were 1, 2, or 3 to “Not Good” and 4 or 5 to “Good”. This will be the variable that our model is trying to predict.

## Provenance
This dataset is accessible from a study done on Amazon reviews [1]. A JSON file is available for use via a link for download. We decided to use the smaller dataset for pet products because the larger one would not download for us properly (small datasets for experimentation).

## License
Anyone can use this data set as long as the data is cited somewhere in the report.
